# Example of Spiral Model

Imagine you're developing a new mobile banking app. You might:
1. **First iteration**: Create a basic version of the app with login and balance checking.
2. **Risk analysis**: Assess security risks and address them.
3. **Second iteration**: Add more features like money transfer and bill payments.
4. **Repeat**: Iterate and refine based on feedback and evolving risks.
