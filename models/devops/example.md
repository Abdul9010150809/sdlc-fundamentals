# Example of DevOps Model

Imagine you're building an e-commerce website. With DevOps, your process might include:
1. **Continuous Integration**: Developers frequently commit code to a shared repository.
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Code is automatically deployed to production after passing automated tests.
3. **Monitoring**: The system is continuously monitored for any issues.
