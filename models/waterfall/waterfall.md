# Waterfall Model

## What is it?
The Waterfall model is a linear approach where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one. Think of it like a staircase: you can't move to the next step without completing the previous one.

## When to use?
- When requirements are clear and fixed.
- Suitable for smaller projects.

## Advantages:
- Simple to understand.
- Easy to manage due to its rigid structure.

## Limtations- 
- Hard to Change: These changes are mostly impossible once a phase is over because it can only lead to incurring more expenses.

- Unclear Requirements: Takes into account that all the requirements are clear at the start of the project, which is rarely the case with a large and/or demanding project.

- Late Testing: Testing occurs after development, and therefore it becomes really difficult to deal with massive problems later- .

- Not Good for Evolving Projects: This approach does not apply well in situations where the requirements of a project are likely to change frequently.

- High Risk: One integral element or a conceptual error could cost a lot of money during the redesigning process.

- Late Delivery: It is cumbersome because the full product is presented at the end with little or no opportunity for its audience to give feedback.
