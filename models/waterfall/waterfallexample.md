# Example of Waterfall Model

Imagine you're developing a school management system. The requirements are clear: the software should manage student records, attendance, and grades. You can plan everything upfront and follow the phases sequentially:

1. **Planning**: Define the scope.
2. **Design**: Create a database schema.
3. **Implementation**: Code each module.
4. **Testing**: Test the whole system.
5. **Deployment**: Install it on school servers.
6. **Maintenance**: Provide updates if needed.
