# Deployment Phase

## Why?
Deployment is about releasing the software to users.

## When?
This happens after successful testing.

## How?
1. Deploy the software on servers or app stores.
2. Monitor for any issues post-launch.

### Example:
Deploy your to-do list app to Google Play Store or a web server so users can download and use it.
