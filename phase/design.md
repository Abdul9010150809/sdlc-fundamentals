# Design Phase

## Why?
The design phase focuses on creating a blueprint for your software. This helps developers understand how the system should work.

## When?
This phase comes after planning and before implementation.

## How?
1. Create diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, UML diagrams).
2. Design the user interface (UI).
3. Plan the database structure.

### Example:
For your to-do list app, you'd sketch out how the task list will look, where buttons will be placed, and what happens when a user interacts with the app.
