# Implementation Phase

## Why?
This is where the actual coding happens. Developers turn the design into a functional product.

## When?
This phase follows the design phase.

## How?
1. Developers write code based on design documents.
2. Use programming languages like Python, Java, etc.
3. Follow coding best practices.

### Example:
If you're building the to-do list app, this is where you write code to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
