# Testing Phase

## Why?
Testing ensures the software is free of bugs and works as expected.

## When?
This happens after implementation but before deployment.

## How?
1. Write test cases to cover different scenarios.
2. Perform different types of testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing).

### Example:
For the to-do list app, you'd test:
- Adding a new task.
- Editing a task.
- Deleting a task.
