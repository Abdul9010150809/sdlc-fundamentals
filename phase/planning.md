# Planning Phase

## Why?
The planning phase is crucial because it sets the direction for the entire project. It answers questions like:
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- What are the project's goals?
- Who are the stakeholders?

## When?
This phase happens at the very beginning of a project, before any actual development starts.

## How?
During this phase, teams:
1. Gather requirements from stakeholders.
2. Define project scope, budget, and timelines.
3. Create a high-level plan.

### Example:
Imagine you're building a simple to-do list app. In the planning phase, you'd decide:
- The app will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
- It should work on mobile and desktop.
- You need it ready in 2 months with a budget of $500.
