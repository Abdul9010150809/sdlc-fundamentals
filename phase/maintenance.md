# Maintenance Phase

## Why?
Software needs regular updates to fix bugs, add new features, or improve performance.

## When?
This happens after deployment and continues as long as the software is in use.

## How?
1. Monitor user feedback.
2. Release updates and patches.

### Example:
If users report a bug in your to-do list app, you'll fix it and release an update.
